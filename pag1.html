        This Future is for everyone

        The future of art isn't for genius.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The world thinks that artists are crazy or live in wonderland, many people don't think of possibly living for art, why agree that the artist has to be genius.

      <p>
        But everyone can turn their emotions, thoughts and memories into valuable works.
