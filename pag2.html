          <h2>Minimalist ilutrastion</h2>
          <p>
            A minimalist illustration reflects the idea that less is more. It
            takes complex concepts and ideas and finds the simplest (yet,
            efficient) ways to transmit them visually. Minimalism is trendy, but
            it is not exactly new since it typically follows aesthetic and
            cultural values as they evolve. Minimalism illustration allows
            designers and artists to focus on the subject's core by exploring
            the power of clean and clear lines and shapes.

          <h2>Art with recyclables</h2>
          <p>
            This type of art seeks to transform waste such as paper, cardboard,
            wood, glass, plastics, metals and rubber into works of art. The
            concept, therefore, goes beyond the conventional recycling of
            materials by creating objects that exceed the economic, cultural and
            social value of the original product.
